# Famous People

Famous People is a simple and easy to use read only REST API.

# Motivations

The objective of this project is to create a crowd sourced API where people can
query information about a person. Information can also be entered easily and the information can then be queried.

# Flow

When this PR is merged, it will re-create the needed pages which are statically generated for the REST API to work.
